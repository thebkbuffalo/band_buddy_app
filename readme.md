# Band Buddy!

Band buddy is an app designed to help Musicians find Bands to play with, and help Bands find new Musicians to join their outfit.  

The use of my app is SUPER simple.  Just clone it down, bundle install, spin it up and you're good to go.  Fill out the the music preferences form, and see what your percentage of matchiness is with other users.
