# Band Buddy!

Band buddy is an app designed to help Musicians find Bands to play with, and help Bands find new Musicians to join their outfit.  

The use of my app is SUPER simple.  Just clone it down, bundle install, spin it up and you're good to go.  Fill out the music preferences form, and see what your percentage of matchability is with other users.  

This is an ongoing project of an idea that I truly love.  The front end needs an entire new look, and the UX needs an immense amount of work.  Foundation or Angular will be brought in to redo the front end with.
